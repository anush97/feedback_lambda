Here's a **brief explanation** you can give your manager on how the updated logic handles both a **`dict`** and an **`AWS4Auth` object**:

1. **If `auth` is a `dict`**:
   - The code treats the `dict` as **custom authentication headers** (for example, an API token or specific request headers).
   - These headers are automatically added to the session when making requests to Elasticsearch. 
   - This follows the logic from the previous implementation, where `auth` as a `dict` was handled as headers without causing errors. It allows flexibility for use cases that donâ€™t require AWS signing but instead use tokens or other header-based authentication.

2. **If `auth` is an `AWS4Auth` object**:
   - The code uses **AWS4Auth for signing the requests** to Elasticsearch.
   - This ensures proper authentication with AWS credentials, leveraging the built-in AWS signing mechanism (which handles region-specific credentials and session tokens).
   - This behavior is important when interacting with AWS-managed Elasticsearch clusters that require signed requests for authentication.

### Summary to Manager:
- If `auth` is a **`dict`**, the headers are added directly to the session for custom authentication (e.g., API tokens).
- If `auth` is an **`AWS4Auth` object**, the requests are signed using AWS credentials for secure communication with AWS services.
- This approach retains flexibility while ensuring correct authentication for both custom header-based and AWS-signed requests.
