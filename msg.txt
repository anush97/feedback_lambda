Hi , quick update: I've updated the logic for Elasticsearch, including user groups and authentication. However, two tests are failing due to the changes in elasticsearch.py - calls_id_GET , queue_id_updater since they also involve creation of es_client. Before I fix these, can you let me know if this approach seems correct? And should authentication be included for these 2 files? Thanks!
